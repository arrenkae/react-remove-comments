Code complexity means a level of diffictulty in understanding, maintaining and modifying a particular piece of software code.
It is influenced by various factors, such as the number of lines of code, number of methods and functions, nesting, inheritance etc.
Reducing complexity is important to make the code readable and easier to maintain, simplify testing process and optimize performance.
Measuring code complexity can be subjective, but there are different metrics and tools that help properly evaluate it.

Complexity of my solution is represented by following factors:

- 2 functional components within the App component
- ReadFile component: 19 lines of code, 1 import, 5 functions/methods, 3 conditions, max nesting depth 1
- Output component: 33 lines of code, 2 imports, 17 functions/methods, 1 loop, 7 conditions, max nesting depth 3
